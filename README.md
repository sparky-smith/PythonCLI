# CoronaSafe Engineering Fellowship Test Problem Solving


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!********************WELCOME USER**********************!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CLI in the todo.py excecutes every condition mentioned successfully.

NOTE :-
1. As my administrator name carries a space in between i can't test the file in any possible way.

2. But every code can be manually tested.

3. The user has to handle the todo.txt path (in line no-14, 44, 70, 84 and 174) and done.txt(in line no 175 and 86) in todo.py file

4. change the python.exe path and the todo.py path in the todo.bat file (The first "" is for python.exe and the later one is for todo.py, leave the rest as they are)

5. And we are ready to go( As per the sample video and instructions it runs after all the above things are done!)



Thank you for giving your time!
This project taught a lot!
