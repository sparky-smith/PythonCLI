# Building a Command Line Interface Using Python


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!********************WELCOME USER**********************!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CLI in the todo.py excecutes every condition mentioned in the "Uses" successfully and also u can add to it.

NOTE :-

1. The user has to handle the todo.txt path (in line no-14, 44, 70, 84 and 174) and done.txt(in line no 175 and 86) in todo.py file

2. change the python.exe path and the todo.py path in the todo.bat file (The first "" is for python.exe and the later one is for todo.py, leave the rest as they are)




Thank you for giving your time!
